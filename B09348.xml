            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, <hi>the iniquity of the Amorites was not full,</hi> and ſo the puniſhment was deferr'd till after four Generations, <hi>viz.</hi> 400. years, when they were ripe for Judgement.

For after 77. years, <hi>[viz.</hi> after the ſaid year 1589.] when her wickedneſs &amp; blaſphemies are arrived to the heighth, when there is no remedy nor healing, when ſhe is ripe for puniſhment, then ſhall the Judgement, that hath ſo long attended for her, at length lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thus ſaith the truth, in the year, which ſhall be</hi> 1666. <hi>the judgement, pronounced, ſhall lay hands on thee, And as all thy fearful wings and feathers be already deſcended and blown down, ſo

Shepheards and Clownes have beene Divines ſometimes, and why not I? I doe not adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe you concerning the wiſdome of a Princeſſe of this World, how to relieve your people if they be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, nor how to curb them if fullneſſe make them wanton, nor how to raiſe a little weale to great, nor how to uphold it from falling downe againe (for all theſe things may you doe and periſh) but I adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe you concerning a wiſdome from above, which if you underſtand and doe thereafter, then ſhall your Scepter be a Scepter of continuance, and you a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and a Queene for ever, not like to <hi>Babylon,</hi> nor Monarch of the Eaſt, nor like the rakehell rout of Emperors and Kaiſers of this world, which for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon flouriſh, and then goe downe to hell: but like unto his Servant <hi>David,</hi> who in the dayes of his fleſh,

And this wiſedome which we ſpeake is a Law, not that of fearfull <hi>Sinai,</hi> a Law of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a Statute of execution, a Covenant of death, condemning the tranſgreſſor to everlaſting captivity; But it is a Law proceeding out of <hi>Sion,</hi> a Law of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, a Statute of deliverance, a Covenant of life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming the ſinner from the wrath of the day to come.

The whole nature and work of this heavenly wiſdome, is perfectly ſet out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto us in theſe two. Firſt, in her Tree, next in the fruit thereof. Her Tree in Scripture is diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered by the names of cleanſing, or waſhing, or purging, and ſometimes expreſſed by a borrowed word, as a new making, a new birth, a birth from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, a re-begetting, and is ſo called, not in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:192286:39"/> but in a ſpirituall meaning, not becauſe it redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth us into our parents, calling us out of their bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells againe, but by comparation &amp; way of ſimilitude, that like as by our naturall and fleſhly generation, we are borne ſervants and ſons of wrath, which ſometimes we were not, ſo by this ſpirituall generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and birth from above, wee are borne free, and made the ſons of God, which by nature wee are not: for that which is of nature is fleſh, ſubdued unto ſin, imbondaged to death, and cannot ſee the inheritance and Kingdome of God; but that which is born from above, is Spirit, redeemed from the captivity of ſin and of death, and choſen to inherite the Kingdome and promiſe of God. And this birth and propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from above, is wrought and brought to paſſe by theſe two, to wit, by water and by fire, whereof this purgeth, the other prepareth. I doe not meane the water of <hi>Jordane,</hi> nor any waters from below, for it is impoſſible for the water of fountaines, to breake, to mollifie, or to prepare the ſinner, but the water of this birth is a force and vertue from above, which turneth, and as it were tranſhapeth the hard and ſtony heart of the ſinner into tears, preparing it by this kind of water, to receive the promiſe and redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God. And therefore the Scripture compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the man that is begotten by water, to a Mount that is become a Valley, unto a Cedar now become a Plant, to a rough and crooked way that is become a plaine, unto a wiſe and prudent one, but now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a babe, unto a ſtone transformed to fleſh, and to a ſubſtance hard as Diamond, tranſlated to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as ſoft as water: by theſe and ſuch like ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, deſcribing the man whoſe heart is turned from all the joyes and contentments of ſin, into a feare and ſorrow for them, and from all her temporary and falſe pleaſing luſts, into a reſtleſſe and indicible deſire to be reſtored to grace, and reconciled to God again.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:192286:40"/> For the hill doth not more differ from the Valley, the Cedar from the plant, the crooked from the plaine, the diſcreetly aged from the little child, the hardneſſe of flint from the ſoftneſſe of fleſh, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Diamond from the nature of water, theſe (I ſay) differ not each from other more, then this man now from that he was. And this is the birth and preparative of water, called in Scripture the <hi>Baptiſme of John.</hi> Whoſe miniſtry was ordained (as teſtifieth the Prophet) to prepare the way before the great Redeemer, and Meſſenger of the Covenant, <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 1. 4. 6.</note> by turning the hearts of the Children into water, like to the hearts of their Fathers, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> that God might alſo turne unto them in mercy and love, as hee did unto thoſe their Fathers And therefore his Lord in a certaine Scripture, gave him (in regard of his miniſtry) that honourable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, namely, that he was more then a Prophet, <note place="margin">Mat 11 9. 11.</note> and that among al the Sons of women there was none found his gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I doe not meane the fire of this world, nor yet the Element ſo called, for it's imipoſſible for any ſuch fires, to purge, to ſanctifie, or to refine the ſinner. But the fire of this birth is a heavenly power, and finger from above, which wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the heart prepared by water, and in no other Tables, the indeleble Covenant of mercy and love, which (before all worlds) in the precious blood of the Mediator thereof, God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Sons for ever; namely, that he would remember their ſins, and their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties no more; and that he would be to them a God <note place="margin">To <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The fourth and laſt branch of this Tree of life, is Love, the light and perfection of the whole eſtate and travell of a Chriſtian: for can a City built upon a hill, hide her face from the paſſer by? or may a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice ſalted, convey his ſeaſoning from the mouth of the taſter? may the Sun ſhine, and not ſhew his beauty? or may a Candle burne, and not bewray her light? And tho theſe creatures could forget their natures, yet cannot the plant in whoſe heart the eternall Covenant of Love is once engraven, forget to burne with like affection, firſt toward God, then to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men.

                  </p>
                  <p>And this is that Love, and that new Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoſe often praiſe ſhineth in the two lights and Lamps of God, which burn before his Throne day and night, and no man can attaine thereto, or have his part therein, that hath not firſt been cleanſed by the promiſe of the Father, which is the Spirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption wherein he cryeth <hi>Abba Father.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the third verſe of this Chapter, the Prophet made mention of theſe contrary feathers, which in their thoughts conſpired to raiſe their houſe with the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins of <hi>Rome.</hi> And here proceedeth more particularly to declare their number, foretelling there ſhould be eight of them whom we will here call out by name, that if occaſion ſerve, we may the better know them.

                  <p>And if in reading doubt ariſe, how theſe eight fethers may be contrary to the Eagle, that is, reſiſters of her power and dominion, and yet be feathers of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, that is, mainteiners of the ſame; The anſwer is, that they were adverſaries and contrary unto her, as ſhe ſtood upon tearmes of <hi>Imperium orbis terrae:</hi> but after ſhe had chang'd her coppy, and claimed ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy under the cloake of <hi>Mater Eccleſia,</hi> they were for the moſt, maintainers of her pride, and became drunke alſo with her worſhip, as other Kings and Princes of th'earth.</p>

                  <p>And the Prophet ſaw, that two of the ſix divided themſelves in counſel &amp; manner of proceeding, from th'other four: for whereas the four ſought to be Lords of <hi>Rome</hi> in fee, reſolving in their thoughts, t'extinguiſh the name and majeſty of her Empire for ever, theſe 2. were of an other mind, for they agreed to remain under the countenance &amp; favour of th'eagles right head, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to wear a crown tho with leave of it: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the right head th'eaſt Empire, ſo called, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it was far ſtronger in power then the weſt: whoſe broad-ſpeading honor (as in the verſe foregoing) was now become a ſtarv'ling, only his name and appellation continued ſome ten ſucceſſions, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Valentinian.</hi> 2 <hi>Maximus</hi> 3 <hi>Avitus.</hi> 4 <hi>Majorianus.</hi> 5 <hi>Severus.</hi> 6 <hi>Anthemius.</hi> 7 <hi>Olybrius.</hi> 8 <hi>Glycerius.</hi> 9 <hi>Iulius Nepos.</hi> 10 <hi>Momyllus.</hi> Which all alſo vaniſhed (as before is Toucht) in 20 years.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:192286:54"/> ſo was <hi>Momyllus</hi> called) and with him deſcended the name and title of <hi>Imperium Romanum</hi> for ever.</p>
                  <p>And the two wings thus divided in policy from the the four, were <hi>Genſerick</hi> and <hi>Theodorick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of which the firſt, trained into Italy by treaſon of th'Empres, entred Rome 43. years after ſhe had been humbled by the <hi>Goths,</hi> and led into captivity all her treaſure, and (as is the fatal reward of ſuch offenders) the traitres alſo her ſelfe. And after 14 days thus loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, departed into his <hi>Africa</hi> again; where-over he reigned in peace and pleaſure 51 years.</p>
                  <p>Th'other, having obtained of th'eaſt-head the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Italy, according to his patent proceeded, and got it by Conqueſt from <hi>Odoacer.</hi> But after he had reigned there-over 30 years deſcended alſo, leaving his <note place="margin">494.</note> fame and kingdom to his poſterity, having fulfild his pleaſures 42 more.</p>
                  <p>But this Counſel pleaſed not th'other 4. for as the verſe concludeth, they remained in other thoughts; drifting in their place to riſe and reigne, without leave or licenſe of any.</p>
                  <p>Ver. 25. <hi>So I looked, and behold, the under-wings thought to ſet up themſelves, and to have the rule.</hi>

                  <p>And as the Prophet beheld the four contrary fethers which were left, he ſaw how they alſo ſtrove in their hearts to eſtabliſh themſelves, but like a dream their purpoſe vaniſhed, in the next immediate ver. following.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But his glory indured not: for after he had reigned eighteen yeers, <hi>Theodorick</hi> (as in the 24 verſe) took his Kingdom from him by force, and his liſe by fraud; and he deſcended, and appeared no more.</p>
                  <p>Ver. 27. <hi>And the ſecond was ſooner gone then the firſt.</hi>

                  <p>Ver. 29. <hi>But whilſt they ſo thought, behold, there awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked one of the heads that were at reſt, which was in the midſt, for that was greater then the two.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whilſt they thus thought, behold there awaked one of the three Kingdoms, appointed to finiſh and end the wickedneſſe of th'Eagle, figuring by this reſting head, the new weſt Empire, which title of Supremacy the beaſt beſtowed (as hath been alwayes his practiſe to run with the ſtrongeſt) upon <hi>Charls</hi> King of France, and ſon to <hi>Pepin</hi> the Traitor. This head is ſaid to be awaked, when it was firſt raiſed, which was in the year, 801. wherein it received his Auguſtal robe, his crown, and ſtile, viz. <hi>Carolo Auguſto a Deo Coronato, magno &amp; pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſimo Imperatori Romanorum, vita &amp; victoria.</hi> And the title of dignity Imperiall, which had laien dead above three hundred years, was in this year on Chriſtmas day, thus raiſed up to life again, to the end it might defend the proceedings of the great adulteres and murderes of the earth, as by the form of oath exhibited at his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration appeareth; <hi>In nomine Chriſti ſpondeo, atque polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceor ego A.

                  </p>
                  <p>In that this head is ſaid to be in the mideſt, is meant, that it ſhould be choſen from among the Nations and Kingdoms of the earth, as by experience hath been proved: Firſt, from France, then from divers King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and parts of Germany, where it ſtill remaineth.</p>
                  <p>And that the fear and power of this head hath been greater then any other Chriſtian King or Kingdome
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:192286:56"/> whatſoever, is it not ſufficiently read in the particular regiſters of every Nation?</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 30. <hi>And I ſaw, that the two heads were joyned there-with.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the two heads, are ſhadowed the two Kingdoms of France and Spaine, whoſe unhallowed league the Prophet fore-ſeeing, ſaith; they ſhould be joyned with this middle-head, and like three parts in one, accord and agree together, to humble themſelves, their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and power before the beaſt, and for their idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhepheard ſhould fight againſt the Higheſt, till by the breath of his mouth they be ſcattered, like the duſt which the winde diſperſeth.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are the three heads mentioned in the firſt, fourth, and ninth verſes of this chapter; and are therefore ſaid to finiſh and determine the laſt end and wickedneſſe of the whore, becauſe tho all other Kingdoms hate her and make her deſolate and naked, and eat her fleſh, as England and others have done: yet theſe three heads ſhall love her ſtill, and to their dying day ſhall burne in delight with her, but when thoſe three and every of them, ſhall alſo forſake her, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>And behold, the middle head was turned with them that were turned with it, and did eat up the two under wings which thought to reigne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Prophet ſaw this middle head (the head of evill,) impart his fellowſhip to all Princes and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which deſired to be in league with it. But my taske which haſteth to an end, will not ſuffer me now, and here, to ſound this gulfe of <hi>Santa Liega;</hi> ſufficeth that for Sions ſake the Prophet paſſing by, doth point thereat.</p>
                  <p>And the Prophet beheld, that this middle head did devour and eat up the under wings, namely the power of the <hi>Longohards,</hi> and th'<hi>inteſtine faction,</hi> which thought alſo to reigne.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 36. <hi>Then I heard a voice, which ſaid, look before thee, and conſider the things which thou ſeeſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 37. <hi>So I ſaw, and behold, as it were a Lyon came haſtily out of the wood, roaring; And I ſaw that he ſent out a mans voice unto the Eagle, and ſpake, ſaying:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ 38 <hi>Hear thou, and I ſhall tell thee, what the moſt High doth ſay unto thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The roaring of the Lion is the breath of the Higheſt, which ſhall rebuke th'Eagle for her unrighteouſnes, and caſt before her all her ſpoyls, and ſet her alive in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and with the ſpirit of his mouth riſe up againſt her; and lay unto her charge as in the text following.</p>
                  <p>Ver. 39. <hi>Art not thou he which of the 4 Beaſts remaineſt, whom I made to reigne in my world, that by them the end of things might come?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Verſ. 40. <hi>And the fourth is come, and hath overcome all the beaſts that were paſt, and obtained power over the world with great fearfulnes, and over the whole compaſſe of the earth with extream oppreſſion, and hath poſſeſſed ſo long time all the world with deceit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ver. 41. <hi>For thou haſt not judged the earth with truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ver. 42. <hi>But haſt troubled the meck and hurt the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and thou haſt loved lyers, and deſtroyed the dwellings of them which brought forth fruit, and haſt caſt down the wals of ſuch as did thee no harme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ver. 43. <hi>So as thy unjuſt dealing is aſcended to the moſt High, and thy pride unto the Mighty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ver. 44. <hi>And therefore he that is Higheſt, hath beheld the proud times, and behold they are ended, and their abominations are finiſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if thou plead not guilty hereunto, behold, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand witneſſes ſhall riſe up againſt thee, and prove the inditement true; that the juſt judgement which hath ſo long attended for thee, may at the length be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt thee, in form as in the text followeth</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:192286:58"/>
                  <p>Verſ. 45. <hi>Therefore appeare no more thou Eagle, nor thy fearfull wings, nor thy wicked fethers, nor thy malitious heads, nor thy cruel claws, nor thy vaine body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And leaſt in thy drunkennes thou maiſt think, thy ſin may over-ſhoot this judgement to come, and in thy madnes glorifie thy ſelfe as thou haſt ever done, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading thy ſelfe thou ſhalt ever be, becauſe thou haſt been long, and like a fool haſt not conſidered, the more thy yeares the nigher thy grave; behold, thus ſaith the truth; In the year which ſhall be 1666. this <note place="margin">Rev. 13. 18.</note> judgement here pronounced ſhall lay hands on thee. And as all thy fearfull wings, and fethers, be already deſcended and blown down; ſo before that day (which is ſo nigh at hand) the tyranny of thy malitious heads, and cruel claws, ſhall be conſumed and brought to nought. And in that day, thy vaine body ſhall be burnt with fire, and ſhall ſo cleane be cut off from the land of the living, that neither ſon nor nephew (as the Prophet <note place="margin">Eſay 14. 22 Eſay 14. 24</note> ſaith) nor branch nor remnant of thy name, ſhall be found upon the earth. <hi>For as it is purpoſed, ſo ſhall it come to paſſe; and as it is conſulted it ſhall ſtand.</hi>

                  <p>Go to now, take counſell of thy Seers, and call thy inchanters about thee; build thy devices as high as heaven, and lay their foundations low as hell, yet ſhall they not deliver thee from the day appointed: but as <hi>Salmanazar</hi> deſtroyed <hi>Beth-arbel</hi> in the day of battel, wherein the mother with the children was daſht in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; or like the milſtone, which the mighty Angel did caſt into the Sea, with ſuch violence ſhalt thou be thrown down, and be found no more.</p>
